## Snake

Snake is a typescript-like programming language that compiles to [brainf*ck](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck, an
esoteric language.

Snake current supports:

- Variable assignment:

```ts
let myVariable = 2;
```

- Print to console (I am too lazy to implement console.log)

```ts
print(1, 2, x)
```

- Types: Byte, Unit, Function

- Sum of bytes:

```ts
print(sum(60, 2, 3))
```
(prints 'A'.)
